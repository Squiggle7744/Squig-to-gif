# Squig To Gif
## Background
Chromie Squiggles are a collection of 10,000 outputs from a p5.js program written by Erick Calderon aka Snowfro.
In Snowfro's p5.js algorithm, an option exists to animate any given output, but is not on by default. In order to more easily showcase this functionality, I've built an app which takes a tokenID (#0-#10,000) and returns a download for the resulting chromie Squiggle in a .gif format.

## Features

## Limitations
- 5 seconds long
- Fixed 600x400 resolution
- White BG only

## Looking forward
There's a plethora of p5.js projects which contain animation. Hopefully I can whitelabel the script and eventually create a simple way to create .gifs of ANY p5.js project.
